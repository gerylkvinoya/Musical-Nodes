# Musical-Nodes -- CS 445 Project

Geryl Vinoya, Tony Hayden, Connor Morgan, Kai Vickers

## Description
This project consists of creating a web application where users can input an artist or song and the site will create a web map of other artists that they have worked with and the connections they have up to a certain depth. Selecting an artist will reveal information about their collaboration(s) and a link to their Spotify page. The purpose of this project is to provide a way for people to find new music and artists to listen to that are similar in taste to what they enjoy.
